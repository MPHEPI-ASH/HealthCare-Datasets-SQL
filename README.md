# Using R to convert a CSV file into SQL 'Create Table'

### Manually creating `CREATE TABLE` statements for PostgreSQL is time-consuming, especially with large healthcare datasets.
So I wrote an **R script** to auto-generate the SQL code for me.

 **Note:** The script sets every column as `TEXT` by default.  
> You'll need to manually change the data types to match the actual content (`INTEGER`, `NUMERIC`, `BOOLEAN`, etc.).


``
### loading the CSV file
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/computername/Downloads/healthcare_dataset.csv")
#turning the names sql safe
names(data) <- make.names(names(data), unique = TRUE)

#creating the SQL code
sql_cols <- paste(sprintf('"%s" TEXT', names(data)), collapse = ",\n  ")
create_sql <- sprintf("CREATE TABLE hospital_capacity (\n  %s\n);", sql_cols)

#printing for copy and paste
cat(create_sql)

**7. Which season had the highest number of hospital admissions overall?**

### üë©‚Äçüè´ Solution
longer version
```sql
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_of_admission) IN (12, 1, 2) THEN 'Winter'
    WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_of_admission) IN (3, 4, 5) THEN 'Spring'
    WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_of_admission) IN (6, 7, 8) THEN 'Summer'
    ELSE 'Fall'
  END AS admission_season,
  COUNT(*) AS admissions_count
FROM hospital_capacity
GROUP BY 
  CASE 
    WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_of_admission) IN (12, 1, 2) THEN 'Winter'
    WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_of_admission) IN (3, 4, 5) THEN 'Spring'
    WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_of_admission) IN (6, 7, 8) THEN 'Summer'
    ELSE 'Fall'
  END
ORDER BY admissions_count DESC;
```
### üë©‚Äçüè´ alernative Solution
shorter code The second version uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) with a WITH clause to define the season once and reuse it throughout the query.

```sql
WITH seasonal_admissions AS (
  SELECT 
    CASE 
      WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_of_admission) IN (12, 1, 2) THEN 'Winter'
      WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_of_admission) IN (3, 4, 5) THEN 'Spring'
      WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_of_admission) IN (6, 7, 8) THEN 'Summer'
      ELSE 'Fall'
    END AS season
  FROM hospital_capacity
)
SELECT 
  season AS admission_season,
  COUNT(*) AS admissions_count
FROM seasonal_admissions
GROUP BY season
ORDER BY admissions_count DESC;
```
Answer:
The highest overall admission is Summer.

**8. What is the distribution of patients by breast cancer risk level based on gender and blood type?**

**I dont have external data. Generating dummy breast cancer risk level by blood type and gender.** 
Step 1: Create the temp table
```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE female_blood_risk 
	(blood_type TEXT,
  breast_cancer_risk TEXT);
```
Step 2: Insert values 
```sql
INSERT INTO female_blood_risk VALUES
  ('O+', 'High Risk'),
  ('A+', 'High Risk'),
  ('A-', 'High Risk'),
  ('O-', 'Low Risk'),
  ('A-', 'Low Risk'),
  ('B-', 'Low Risk');
```
### üë©‚Äçüè´ Solution

```sql
-- Classify patients by breast cancer risk
WITH risk_classified AS (
  SELECT
    CASE
      WHEN hc.gender ILIKE 'female' AND fbr.blood_type IS NOT NULL THEN fbr.breast_cancer_risk
      WHEN hc.gender ILIKE 'female' THEN 'Medium Risk'
      ELSE 'Unknown Risk'
    END AS breast_cancer_risk
  FROM hospital_capacity AS hc
-- Join on blood type
  LEFT JOIN female_blood_risk AS fbr
    ON hc.blood_type = fbr.blood_type
)
-- Count patients by risk level
SELECT 
  breast_cancer_risk,
  COUNT(*) AS patient_count
FROM risk_classified
GROUP BY breast_cancer_risk
ORDER BY 
  CASE breast_cancer_risk
    WHEN 'High Risk' THEN 1
    WHEN 'Medium Risk' THEN 2
    WHEN 'Low Risk' THEN 3
    ELSE 4
  END;

### 9. How are hospital patients distributed across billing amount quartiles?

### üë©‚Äçüè´ Solution

```sql
--creating temp file for billing quartiles and unique_patient
with billing_quartile as (
	select 
		lower (trim(name)) as unique_patient,
		Billing_amount,
		ntile(4) over (order by billing_amount) as quartile
	from hospital_capacity
)
--writing the patient per quartile and billing range
select
	quartile as billing_quartile,
	count (distinct unique_patient ) as patient_count,
	min (billing_amount) as min_billing_amount,
	max (billing_amount) as max_billing_amount
from billing_quartile
group by quartile
order by quartile desc
;
```

### Answer: 

Patients are evenly split into four quartiles based on billing amount. The 1st quartile has the lowest billing range, while the 4th quartile has the highest.
