# Using R to convert a CSV file into SQL 'Create Table'

### Manually creating `CREATE TABLE` statements for PostgreSQL is time-consuming, especially with large healthcare datasets.
So I wrote an **R script** to auto-generate the SQL code for me.

 **Note:** The script sets every column as `TEXT` by default.  
> You'll need to manually change the data types to match the actual content (`INTEGER`, `NUMERIC`, `BOOLEAN`, etc.).


``
### loading the CSV file
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/computername/Downloads/healthcare_dataset.csv")
#turning the names sql safe
names(data) <- make.names(names(data), unique = TRUE)

#creating the SQL code
sql_cols <- paste(sprintf('"%s" TEXT', names(data)), collapse = ",\n  ")
create_sql <- sprintf("CREATE TABLE hospital_capacity (\n  %s\n);", sql_cols)

#printing for copy and paste
cat(create_sql)

**7. Which season had the highest number of hospital admissions overall?**

### üë©‚Äçüè´ Solution
longer version
```sql
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_of_admission) IN (12, 1, 2) THEN 'Winter'
    WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_of_admission) IN (3, 4, 5) THEN 'Spring'
    WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_of_admission) IN (6, 7, 8) THEN 'Summer'
    ELSE 'Fall'
  END AS admission_season,
  COUNT(*) AS admissions_count
FROM hospital_capacity
GROUP BY 
  CASE 
    WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_of_admission) IN (12, 1, 2) THEN 'Winter'
    WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_of_admission) IN (3, 4, 5) THEN 'Spring'
    WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_of_admission) IN (6, 7, 8) THEN 'Summer'
    ELSE 'Fall'
  END
ORDER BY admissions_count DESC;
```
### üë©‚Äçüè´ alernative Solution
shorter code The second version uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) with a WITH clause to define the season once and reuse it throughout the query.

```sql
WITH seasonal_admissions AS (
  SELECT 
    CASE 
      WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_of_admission) IN (12, 1, 2) THEN 'Winter'
      WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_of_admission) IN (3, 4, 5) THEN 'Spring'
      WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_of_admission) IN (6, 7, 8) THEN 'Summer'
      ELSE 'Fall'
    END AS season
  FROM hospital_capacity
)
SELECT 
  season AS admission_season,
  COUNT(*) AS admissions_count
FROM seasonal_admissions
GROUP BY season
ORDER BY admissions_count DESC;
```
Answer:
The highest overall admission is Summer.
